            To Nana, for teaching me first hand the two most important lessons I've learned so far in life:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item against all odds, success can be achieved through hard work.
                \item the relationships built with friends and family are the most important things in life.
            \end{itemize}
            I know you would be proud to see how far we've come.

            R.I.P.
