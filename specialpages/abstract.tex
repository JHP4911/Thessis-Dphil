Quantitative studies of global radiation damage are presented for two different types of experiments in structural biology: macromolecular crystallography (MX) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)

In MX, global radiation damage is characterised by an overall loss in the diffracted intensity of Bragg reflections during data collection.
