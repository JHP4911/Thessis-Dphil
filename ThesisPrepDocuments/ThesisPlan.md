Thesis Plan
===========

\*\* Denotes sections that have already been drafted.

### Work on the Thesis Format

I Need to decide on the visual layout of the thesis and the font that I want to use. I also need to actually get the Latex (I've decided to write it in Latex) document structure in place to write the thesis.

#### Timeline:

-	***27th December 2015 - 2nd January 2016***

### Chapter 1 - Introduction

###### Subheading - Introduction to crystallography

This section will contain a general introduction to crystallography.

-	Why we do it
-	What is involved
-	Limitations and alternatives - XFELS, Cryo-EM. Include radiation damage so it flows nicely into the next section.

###### Subheading - Radiation Damage

-	Explain global and specific damage
-	Mitigation of Radiation Damage
	-	**Pre experiment**
		-	Improving data collection strategies with RADDOSE-3D (DWD) along with a discussion about the history of RADDOSE.
	-	**During experiment**
		-	Cryo-cooling
		-	Scavengers
	-	**Post experiment**
		-	Zero Dose Extrapolation/Damage modelling + French and Wilson scaling
-	Section on Radiation damage in SAXS experiments (SAXS automation improving, scavengers).

###### Subheading - Summary of section

Brief summary of the chapter (X-ray crystallography and radiation damage)

###### Subheading - Thesis Layout
