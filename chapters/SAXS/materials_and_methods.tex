Glucose isomerase (GI) was purchased in \textcolor{red}{...} in tetrameric form from \textcolor{red}{...}.
It was \textcolor{red}{dissolved} and dialysed for about \textcolor{red}{...} hours at \textcolor{red}{$277\ K$} against \textcolor{red}{...(buffer components)...}.
The final GI concentration of \textcolor{red}{($1\ mg/ml$)} used for all data collection runs was determined using the extinction coefficient given by \textcolor{red}{...} at \textcolor{red}{$...\ nm$}.
Eight solution additives were tested for their radiation damage protection efficacies: sodium ascorbate, dithiothreitol (DTT) ethylene glycol, glycerol, sodium nitrate, sucrose, (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and trehalose.
The additives were added to the buffer solutions at four different concentrations: $10\ mM$, $5\ mM$, $2\ mM$ and $1\ mM$, except glycerol and ethylene glycol which were prepared at $10\%\ v/v$, $5\%\ v/v$, $2\%\ v/v$ and $1\%\ v/v$ immediately prior to data collection.
These additives were also prepared to the same final concentration in the solution containing both the buffer and protein.

\subsection{SAXS data collection}
\label{sub:SAXS data collection}
Data collection was performed at the ESRF on beamline BM29 in collaboration with Adam Round and Martha Brennich.
The photon energy used throughout was $12.5\ keV$ and the photon flux was estimated from diode readings which were recorded for every frame using the conversion formula
\begin{equation}
    \text{flux} = 5.72293 + 2.72295 \times 10^{15} \times dr,
\end{equation}
where $dr$ is the diode reading.
The flux obtained using this formula was calibrated with the OSD1-0 photodiode purchased from Optoelectronics, a $500 \mu m$ thick silicon diode with a $ 1\ mm^2 $ active area.
The flux was calculated for each frame because the diode readings constantly changed from frame to frame (Figure~\ref{fig:Diode and flux readings}).

(a) It can clearly be seen that the diode readings decrease throughout the experiment. (b) As a result of the decreasing diode readings the corresponding flux decreases too.}

The 2-dimensional X-ray beam profile was determined from a mixture of measurements, spline interpolation and averaging.
A $100 \mu m$ diameter circular aperture was used to scan across the X-ray beam area and take measurements at $10 \mu m$ intervals.
These readings were then used to determine the entire beam profile using a mixture of the bivariate spline approximation and averaging as outlined in section \textcolor{red}{...(The method will be described in the previous chapter on beam the beam measurements)...}. The resulting beam is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SAXS beam profile}.

Multiple diode measurements were taken with a $100 \mu m$ diameter circular aperture as it scanned across the X-ray beam area.

The data were recorded using a \textcolor{red}{...detector type...}.
Samples were contained in a $1.8\ mm$ quartz capillary ($1.7\ mm$ internal diameter) held at room temperature.
For each additive, data were collected at each concentration (given in section \ref{sub:Sample preparation}), and each of these runs was repeated 3 times.
The exposure time for each frame was 1 second and a total of 120 frames were collected for a single run.
During each experimental run, the sample was kept static.
For each concentration a single run with only the buffer (no protein) was also taken so that a suitable buffer correction could be applied during data analysis.

\subsection{Dose calculation}
\label{sub:Dose calculation}
Dose calculations were performed using RADDOSE-3D with the modifications described in section \ref{sec:Extending RADDOSE-3D for SAXS} for modelling SAXS experiments.
The beam image shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SAXS beam profile} was read directly into RADDOSE-3D and the corresponding flux values recorded for each frame were used to ensure accurate dose estimates.
The FASTA sequence file used to determine the atomic composition was downloaded from PDB entry 4US6, a tetrameric form of GI..
The elemental composition of the quartz capillary was entered into RADDOSE-3D as $SiO_2$.
The capillary thickness was given as $50\ \mu m$ and a density of $2.648\ g/cm^3$ was used.
