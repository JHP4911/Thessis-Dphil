\begin{itemize}
    \item Cylindrical shapes is an explicit input option for RADDOSE-3D sample geometry. It converts a the description of the cylinder provided by the user, diameter and height to a polyhedral geometry description. In fact the current cuboid implementation does the same thing. Therefore currently the only shape that is modelled by RADDOSE-3D that isn't converted to a polyhedral representation for the simulation is the spherical representation.
