\begin{itemize}
    \item Cylindrical shapes is an explicit input option for RADDOSE-3D sample geometry. It converts a the description of the cylinder provided by the user, diameter and height to a polyhedral geometry description. In fact the current cuboid implementation does the same thing. Therefore currently the only shape that is modelled by RADDOSE-3D that isn't converted to a polyhedral representation for the simulation is the spherical representation.
    \item Doesn't yet account for samples flowed through the capillary.
    \item RADDOSE-3D modularity and what extensions are possible.
    \item temperature, HO vs electron scavengers.
    \item Didn't look at the signal to noise of the radioprotectants
    \item CorMap method is what people are likely to use now.
    \item CorMap needs further refinement. Could expose different molecular conformations
\end{itemize}
