\label{sec:Discussion - Zero-dose extrapolation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What Zero-dose extrapolation can do - 1) improve phases 2) it's been done before
    \item Why did we think we could do better - RADDOSE-3D, DWD, new DDM
    \item What we did - probabilistic extrapolation was new, treated the data as one big dataset
    \item It seemed to work
    \item Why did we not see it through - inability to write unmerged MTZ file
    \item What is new about the extrapolation method - only need subset of reflections at high multiplicity
    \item Details need sorting - correlation checking, Scale params $A$ and $B$, $\sigma$ correction needs work, perhaps new extrapolation function. Why/why not non-parametric regression.
\end{itemize}
