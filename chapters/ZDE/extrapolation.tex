\section{Extrapolation routine}
\label{sec:Extrapolation routine}
With both the reflection intensities and the doses extracted, extrapolation can be performed using standard regression techniques.
In particular, parametric regression in which a particular functional form describing the relationship between the two variables was implemented.
The function chosen to describe the relationship between the reflection intensity, $I$, and the dose, $D$, was:
\begin{equation}
    I(D) = K_{\bs{h}} e^{A_{\bs{h}}D^2}
    \label{eq:Extrapolation regression function}
\end{equation}
Where $K, A, B$ are
