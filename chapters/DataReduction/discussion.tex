\begin{itemize}
    \item Bypass the French and Wilson truncation algorithm.
    \item Extension to multiple crystals - Garib's diagram
    \item Calculation of the spherical cap volume fraction - using angles as a proxy not good
    \item Expected intensity value should use BEST data.
    \item Constant $\bs{D}$ assumed. Should allow $\bs{D}_{i+1, i}$ to be different
    \item Need to explicitly calculate expected value of Woolfson distribution for process covariance of centric reflections.
    \item Use Gamma/Beta distribution for the B factor.
    \item Need to model the coordinate error.
    \item Scaling should be done with scaling software - allow changing scale factor.
    \item B-factor shouldn't be assumed linear - use non-parametric regression.
\end{itemize}
