\subsection{Bovine pancreatic insulin}
\label{sub:Bovine pancreatic insulin}

\subsubsection{Scale and B factors}
\label{subs:Scale and B factors - insulin}
Data were collected on a crystal of bovine pancreatic insulin (crystal ID 0259) as described in chapter \ref{chap:Dose Decay Modelling}.
The atomic composition used to provide expected intensity values, was obtained from the insulin structure with PDB code 2BN3.
The B factors could then be calculated for each image according to equation \ref{eq:Log of the scaling observation model} and are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image - insulin}.
It can be seen that there are a couple of points that may be regarded as outliers in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image before outlier removal - insulin}.
To remove the outliers, the mean and standard deviation of the B factors were calculated and any B factor that was more than two standard deviations from the mean was removed.
The resulting B factor distribution is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image after outlier removal - insulin}.

    \label{fig:B factors per image - insulin}
\end{figure}

To ensure that the B-factors exhibited linear behaviour, ``damage corrected'' B factors, $B_{dc}$, were calculated by rearranging the linear formula for the B factor increase.
If the B-factors do show linear behaviour then the ``damage corrected'' B factors should be normally distributed, so the goal is to check for this.
The ``damage corrected'' B factors are determined as
\begin{equation}
    B^i_{dc} = B_i - \Delta B \times i,
\end{equation}
where $B_i$ is the B factor calculated at image $i$, and $\Delta B$ is the gradient of the line fitted to the data.
A histogram of the "damage corrected" B factor distribution was then plotted, which should be a Gaussian distribution centred on the intercept of the line in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image after outlier removal - insulin}.
Additionally a QQ plot\footnote{A QQ plot graphically determines whether two datasets come from the same distribution. It plots the quantiles of the first dataset against the quantiles of the second. If the two datasets come from the same distribution the points should fall on a 45$^{\circ}$ reference line which is typically also plotted.} was used to ensure that the data were normally distributed (Figure~\ref{fig:B factor QQ plot - insulin}).
The gradient $\Delta B$ was calculated to be 0.001$\,$\AA$^2$.

\end{figure}

The set of scale factors calculated from the images, $\{ s_{images} \}$, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factors per image before outlier removal - insulin}.
There did not appear to be any outliers from visual inspection, so there was no outlier rejection method performed for the scale factors.
The scale factors that corresponded to images that were removed from the B factor outlier rejection analysis were also omitted for consistency.
The resulting scale factors, $\{ s^{*}_{images} \}$, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factors per image after outlier removal - insulin}.

    \label{fig:Scale factors per image - insulin}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factor distribution after outlier removal - insulin} presents the distribution of scale factors as a histogram with a kernel density estimation of the distribution overlaid.
The fact that the mode and mean are very similar in value also suggests that the scale factor distribution is Gaussian.
However there is no guarantee that the scale factor distribution for a general experiment will be Gaussian and hence there are no checks for normality included in the algorithm for the scale factors.
The mean scale factor value of the distribution, $s_{mean}$ = 0.010 was used in the forward-backward algorithm, which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment.
This assumption is not true in the general case, but it should be suitable for the diffraction experiment concerned, for which the insulin crystal was completely immersed in a tophat beam for a 45$^{\circ}$ rotation.
This is because the transmission through the crystal and the illuminated volume should remain constant.

\subsubsection{Forward-backward algorithm}
\label{subs:Forward-backward algorithm - insulin}
The forward-backward algorithm was applied with the following parameters defined:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the minimum and maximum number of forward-backward cycles for an individual reflection was 5 and 200 respectively.
    \item the forward-backward cycles were regarded to have converged if:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the maximum number of cycles had been reached (200)
        \item the absolute change in log likelihood between consecutive cycles was less than 0.1
        \item the change in initial amplitude value between consecutive cycles was less than 1
    \end{enumerate}
    \item reflections for which the Rician distribution was used for the amplitude process function (equations \ref{eq:Process function - mean of rice distribution} and \ref{eq:Process covariance - variance of rice distribution}) were defined as reflections where $F_0/\sigma(F_0) <$ 3, where $F_0$ is the initial amplitude estimate.
\end{itemize}
Amplitude estimates resulting from applying the forward-backward algorithm for 4 reflections are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates - insulin}.
It can be seen that for these reflections, the initial amplitude value estimated using CTRUNCATE is within the 95\% confidence region as estimated by the forward-backward algorithm.
In fact the median percentage error between the amplitude estimates for all reflections from CTRUNCATE and the forward-backward algorithm is 3.77\%.
This suggests that the constant scale factor assumption (outlined in section \ref{sub:Obtaining parameter values for the process and observation functions} and graphically depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Scale factors per image after outlier removal - insulin}) used for the simple scaling procedure used for this study is valid for this experiment.

Figures~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,30,38 - insulin} and \ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,37,11 - insulin} exhibit the expected behaviour of an average refection, since both of these reflections decay relatively smoothly as exposure time increases.
Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,49,27 - insulin} shows a reflection whose amplitude increases as the exposure increases.
This demonstrates that the forward-backward algorithm is capable of capturing the different behaviours of various reflections despite the process function describing a monotonic decay of the amplitudes.

Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 2,10,22 - insulin} shows a reflection where the behaviour is very irregular and not very smooth.
In this case it is very likely not to be caused by a physical phenomenon and is probably due to incorrect scaling of the data.
To prevent this problem, restraints should be imposed during the scaling procedure in a similar manner to those of existing scaling methods to ensure sufficient smoothness of reflection amplitudes \cite{evans2013,kabsch2010integration}.
It should be noted that not all sharp changes in amplitudes relate to noise/incorrect processing.
Mechanical or chemical changes of the structure can occur within a few seconds \cite{allan2012}.

Another undesirable feature of the forward-backward algorithm is the fact that the initial amplitude estimate is solely influenced by the amplitude estimate at the point where the observation is made.
This effect is prominent in Figures~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,37,11 - insulin} and \ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,49,27 - insulin}.
Thus the initial amplitude estimate is not influenced by the multiplicity and hence erroneous estimates are more likely to arise if the first observation of a reflection is an outlier.
This can be overcome by performing the forward-backward algorithm on each observation separately and merging the entire amplitude curves for equivalent reflections.
The relative uncertainties at each point in the data collection experiment will be different because the observations will be collected on different images.
This should ensure that the (possibly non-linear) behaviour of the reflection should still be captured by this method.

\subsubsection{Refinement results}
\label{subs:Refinement results - insulin}
To obtain an electron density map of the structure the initial amplitude estimates resulting from the forward-backward algorithm (FBA) were combined with the phases from a deposited insulin structure (PDB code 2BN3) and refined with REFMAC \cite{murshudov2011refmac5} (10 cycles of rigid body refinement followed by 10 cycles of restrained refinement).
The same refinement procedure was performed with data processed using AIMLESS \cite{evans2013} and CTRUNCATE (ACT pipeline) \cite{winn2011} i.e. no processing with the forward-backward algorithm.
The resulting electron density maps contoured at the 3$\sigma$ level (arbitrary choice of $\sigma$ level) at 1.38$\,$\AA\ for selected residues are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Electron density maps - insulin}.
The maps are practically identical for the two different data reduction pipelines, which is the case for the rest of the structure.

    (b) Disulphide bond.
    The electron density maps are practically identical and these are representative of the density around the entire structure.}
    \label{fig:Electron density maps - insulin}
\end{figure}

A difference map was also calculated to locate the major differences between the results of the two different data reduction pipelines.
The differences were calculated between the resulting amplitudes from the ACT and FBA pipelines, rather than the calculated amplitudes after refinement.
Phases for the difference map were obtained from the model generated from the data processed through the ACT pipeline.
Figure~\ref{fig:Difference electron density map - insulin} displays the resulting difference map contoured at the 3$\sigma$ level along with the full insulin structure from which the phases were obtained.
The difference electron density is distributed quite uniformly over the unit cell rather than showing large differences overlapping the structure.
This supports the result shown above that the two methods give practically equivalent electron density for the structure.

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{1.0\textwidth}

    The insulin structure from which the phases were obtained is also shown as a green stick model.
    The difference density is uniformly distributed throughout the unit cell and no large differences can be seen overlapping the structure.
    This suggests that the two methods would result in the same structure as evidenced by the electron density maps in Figure~\ref{fig:Electron density maps - insulin}.}
    \label{fig:Difference electron density map - insulin}
\end{figure}

Refinement statistics for both pipelines are shown in Table \ref{tab:Refinement statistics - insulin}.
Overall the statistics are quite similar but they are consistently better for the ACT pipeline.
It is likely that the FBA results can be improved by merging the amplitude estimates for symmetry related reflections after the algorithm has been applied to each observation individually, as described in section \ref{subs:Forward-backward algorithm - insulin}.
Another difference between the two pipelines is that the FBA pipeline does not include any outlier rejection whereas AIMLESS does.
This is likely to be the reason why there were more reflections at the end of data reduction using the FBA pipeline (16261) compared to that when using the ACT pipeline (16233).

\subsection{Protein-DNA complex - C.Esp1396I}
\label{sub:Protein-DNA complex - C.Esp1396I}

\subsubsection{Scale and B factors}
\label{subs:Scale and B factors - C.Esp1396I}
Data were collected from a crystal of the bacterial protein-DNA complex (C.Esp1396I) as described in Bury \textit{et al.} (2015) (Figure~\ref{fig:C.Esp1396I structure}).
Notably the crystal (30$\,\mu m$ $\times$ 30$\,\mu m$ $\times$ 10$\,\mu m$) was exposed to a 25$\,\mu m$ circular Gaussian profile beam (FWHM dimensions before the 25$\,\mu m$ diameter pinhole are 0.212$\,mm$ $\times$ 0.279$\,mm$), with the crystal oriented such that the 10$\,\mu m$ dimension was aligned parallel to the beam direction.
A single dataset consisted of 100 frames with each frame generated from a 1$^{\circ}$ rotation (100$^{\circ}$ total wedge).
Thus not all of the crystal was immersed in the beam and the rotation led to the X-ray beam path length and illuminated volume through the crystal changing throughout the experiment.

    The radii of the spheres are proportional to the electron density loss and the spheres closer/further than 2$\,$\AA\ from the DNA strands are coloured blue/red \cite{bury2015radiation}.}
    \label{fig:C.Esp1396I structure}
\end{figure}
The atomic composition used to provide expected intensity values was obtained from the PDB structure 4X4B.
The B factors were calculated as described above and are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image - C.Esp1396I}.
Four B factors that were removed in the outlier rejection procedure are clearly visible in Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image before outlier removal - C.Esp1396I} with B factor values of zero.
The initial B factor is much higher for the C.Esp1396I structure (57.69$\,$\AA$^2$) than it was for the insulin structure (12.19$\,$\AA$^2$).
In contrast to the behaviour observed with the insulin dataset, the B factor for the C.Esp1396I structure decreases linearly throughout the dataset (Figure~\ref{fig:B factors per image after outlier removal - C.Esp1396I}).
The assumption of a linear behaviour of the B-factor is again justified (Figure~\ref{fig:Gaussian B factor plots - C.Esp1396I}).

\end{figure}

The calculated scale factor distribution, $\{ s_{images} \}$, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factors per image - C.Esp1396I}.
As with the insulin dataset, no specific outlier rejection was carried out on the scale factors, so the only ones rejected were those that corresponded to the same images on which the rejected B factors were found, i.e. the four scale factors with a value of 1 in Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factors per image before outlier removal - C.Esp1396I}.
The resulting scale factors, $\{ s^{*}_{images} \}$, calculated from the images (Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factors per image after outlier removal - C.Esp1396I}) do not exhibit a constant behaviour.
This implies that the assumption of a constant scale factor (as was assumed to be the case for insulin) is likely to give incorrect results.
The kernel density estimate in Figure~\ref{fig:Scale factor distribution after outlier removal - C.Esp1396I} shows that the scale factor distribution is bimodal and hence a single (constant) value does not represent the distribution adequately.
A varying scale factor has not yet been implemented into the forward-backward algorithm and hence the mean value of the calculated scale factor distribution, $s_{mean}$ = 0.0147, was used as the scale factor in the processing.

\subsubsection{Forward-backward algorithm}
\label{subs:Forward-backward algorithm - C.Esp1396I}
The forward-backward algorithm was carried out with the same parameters as defined for the insulin structure.
The only difference was that a Gaussian approximation was used as the process function for every reflection.
Furthermore the Bayesian inference method described in section \ref{sub:Weak Data} was not performed, because the algorithm suffered numerical issues when calculating the Rician approximation.
This is likely to be due to the calculation of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero for arguments with high values.
Mathematically this function increases in an exponential manner, especially for large argument values, and ultimately reaches a point where an error is flagged.
The Gaussian approximation does not rely on evaluating this function which is why it was used instead for all reflections.
Addressing this issue will require the algorithm to check the size of the argument before evaluating it.

The amplitude estimates for two reflections resulting from the processing are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates - C.Esp1396I}.
As was the case with the insulin dataset, some reflections exhibit smooth behaviour (Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 0,17,48 - C.Esp1396I}), whereas others show sharp changes that are likely to be due to imperfect scale factors (Figure~\ref{fig:Amplitude estimates ref 8,9,4 - C.Esp1396I}).
Due to the incorrect scale factor used for the images in the dataset, the CTRUNCATE and the FBA amplitude values do not agree.
This is confirmed by the median percentage error between the amplitude estimates for all reflections from CTRUNCATE and the forward-backward algorithm which in this case is 272.60\%.

    The estimate produced with CTRUNCATE is shown in green.
    The estimates using the two different pipelines do not agree in both (a) and (b) and this is likely to be due to the incorrect scale factor used for the forward-backward algorithm.
    Reflection 8,9,4 in (b) also exhibits sharp changes in the amplitude, which are likely to be noise.}

\subsubsection{Refinement results}
\label{subs:Refinement results - C.Esp1396I}
To obtain an electron density map of the structure the initial amplitude estimates resulting from FBA were combined with the phases from the deposited C.Esp1396I structure (PDB code 3CLC) and refined with REFMAC \cite{murshudov2011refmac5} (20 cycles of rigid body refinement followed by 20 cycles of restrained refinement).
The same procedure was also performed using the amplitudes calculated using the ACT pipeline.
The resulting electron density maps contoured at the 3$\sigma$ level at 2.4$\,$\AA\ for selected residues are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Electron density maps - C.Esp1396I}.
Once again the maps generally agree structurally but the overlap is less pronounced in this structure than it was for insulin.
This is expected because the amplitude values did not agree as well, largely due to an incorrect scale factor used for the FBA.

The difference map between the amplitude values calculated from the ACT and FBA pipelines, using phases from the final model after refinement with the 3CLC phases and ACT amplitudes, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Difference electron density map - C.Esp1396I}.
The difference density is no longer random and in fact is located around the model.
This suggests that the two different pipelines could lead to different structural models.

    The difference density is not random as it was for the insulin structure.
    Instead most of the difference density is located around the structure, suggesting that the refined models are likely to differ in several regions.}

Again the total number of reflections differ between datasets.
The FBA pipeline results in 32944 reflections at the end of data reduction, whereas the ACT pipeline results in 32898 reflections.

Overall refinement statistics using both pipelines are shown in Table \ref{tab:Refinement statistics - C.Esp1396I}.
The R values are slightly better for the ACT pipeline but the RMS values are lower for the FBA pipeline.
The statistics obtained using the FBA method are much better than expected considering the scale factor used in the FBA was non-optimal.
If the amplitude values resulting from the FBA pipeline are indeed inaccurate then it is likely that the refinement process is significantly ``filtering out'' the errors that are made during the data reduction stage.
It is also possible that the statistical improvement by manually refining the model may be more limited with the data for the FBA pipeline compared to that of the ACT pipeline.
