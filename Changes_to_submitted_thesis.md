19. **Page 275, 2nd paragraph** - glycerol doesn't reduce scattering but increases noise. I.e. Change from:

> Glycerol on the other hand is known to reduce the scattering intensities of the sample (Jeffries et al., 2015)

**to**

> Glycerol on the other hand, is known to increase the noise and hence reduce the observable signal obtained from  the sample (Jeffries et al., 2015)
