# Changes to submitted thesis

### Acknowledgements
1. Add paragraph to thank my housemates.

### Chapter 1 - Introduction
1. **Page 28, last paragraph** - The $a, b, c$ at the start of the paragraph should be bold. i.e. from

> $a, b, c$

**to**
> $\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}$

2. **Page 29, 2nd paragraph** - There are 7 lattice types and 5 centering types change from:

> 7 lattice systems and 7 lattice types

**to**
> 7 lattice systems (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, hexagonal rhombohedral), and 5 crystal centering types (primitive (P), base-centered (A, B, C), face-centered (F), Body-centered (I), Rhombohedrally-centered (R ))

3. **Page 32, 1st paragraph** - missing comma. Change from:

>component, $E_{el}$ of

**to**
>component, $E_{el}$, of

4. **Page 32, 2nd paragraph** - perhaps it should read $\sin(\varphi)$ rather than $\varphi$?. i.e. it should be changed from:

>and $\varphi$ is the component of $E_0$ perpendicular to the scattering electron.

**to**
>and $\sin(\varphi)$ is the component of $E_0$ perpendicular to the scattering electron.

5. **Page 32, 1st line of last paragraph** - need to define $\boldsymbol{r}$ at the end of the sentence. i.e. change from:

> system of two electrons as depicted in Figure 1.5a.

**to**
> system of two electrons where electron 1 is positioned at the origin and electron 2 is at position $\boldsymbol{r}$ relative to electron 1 as depicted in Figure 1.5a.

6. **Page 32, last paragraph** - be explicit that the notation is from Figure 1.5a. I.e. add at the end of the sentence:

> $p + q = \lambda[\boldsymbol{r} \cdot (\boldsymbol{s}_0 - \boldsymbol{s})]$ (where $p$ and $q$ are defined as showen in Figure 1.5a)

7. **Page 33, 2nd paragraph** - spelling mistake. Needs to be changed from:

> the origing (e.g. electron 1)

**to**
> the origin (e.g. electron 1)

8. **Page 34, penultimate paragraph** - should explicitly give formula for $|\boldsymbol{S}|$. i.e. change from:

> on $|\boldsymbol{S}|$ is shown

**to**
> on $|\boldsymbol{S}| = 2\sin(\theta)/\lambda$ is shown

9. **Page 35, paragraph after 1st equation** - it's not the structure of the atoms, rather the structure composed of the atoms. So should be changed from:

> depends on the structure of the atoms within the unit cell

**to**
> depends on the structure composed of the various atoms within the unit cell

10. **page 35, equation 1.1.10** - Needs correcting. From:

> $\boldsymbol{K}(\boldsymbol{S}) \times \sum_{t=0}^{n_1}\exp[2\pi i t\boldsymbol{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}] \times \sum_{u=0}^{n_2}\exp[2\pi i u\boldsymbol{b} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}] \times \sum_{v=0}^{n_3}\exp[2\pi i v\boldsymbol{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}]$

**to**
> $\boldsymbol{K}(\boldsymbol{S}) = \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{S})\times \sum_{t=0}^{n_1}\exp[2\pi i t\boldsymbol{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}] \times \sum_{u=0}^{n_2}\exp[2\pi i u\boldsymbol{b} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}] \times \sum_{v=0}^{n_3}\exp[2\pi i v\boldsymbol{c} \cdot \boldsymbol{S}]$

11. **page 36, equation 1.1.17** - add info about using Laue conditions after equation. i.e. add:

> using the Laue conditions.

after equation 1.1.17.

12. **page 37, last paragraph** - add that we're extracting the amplitudes of each reflection in the dataset. I.e. change from:

>Extracting the amplitudes from the dataset

**to**
> Extracting the amplitudes of each reflection in the dataset.

13. **page 37, last paragraph** - redundant word needs to be deleted. I.e. delete the word:

>programs

at the end of the 3rd sentence.  

14. **Page 38, 1st paragraph** - CCP4 needs to be put in uppercase. I.e. change from:

>with a ccp4 program called AIMLESS

**to**
>with a CCP4 program called AIMLESS.

15. **Page 38, 2nd full paragraph** - Phil Evans paper from 2006 not 2005. Change from:

> (Evans, 2005)

**to**
> (Evans, 2006)

16. **Page 39, last paragraph** - Get of the word "First" at the beginning of the last full sentence of the paragraph.

17. **Page 39, last paragraph** - amplitude should be plural. i.e. changed from:

>improve agreement of the amplitude calculated from

**to**
>improve agreement of the amplitudes calculated from


### Chapter 5 - Beam
1. **Page 219, Figure 5.11 b** - y axis label changed from

> $\mu AA$

**to**
> $\mu A$  

2. **Page 219, Figure 5.11 a and b** - x-axis units changed from

> ($\mu m$)

to

> ($mm$)

### Chapter 6 - SAXS
1. **Page 266, Figure 6.20, caption** - Changed from  

> "Teal"

**to**
> "Green"

2. **Pages 267 and 271** - "Trehalose" spelt with capital "T", it shouldn't be. Changed from

> Trehalose

**to**

> trehalose
